Steps to Implement Self-Healing Infrastructure with AWS Auto Scaling

1.  Set Up an AWS EC2 Auto ScalingGroup
●             Launch an EC2 instance and configure it with the required application setup.
●             Create an AmazonMachine Image (AMI)of this instance for auto-scaling.

2.  Create a Launch Templateor Launch Configuration

●             Go to the EC2 Dashboard → Auto Scaling → Launch Templates.
●             Create a launchtemplate using the previously createdAMI and define

instance type, securitygroup, and key pair.

3.  Configure an Auto ScalingGroup (ASG)

●             Go to Auto ScalingGroups and createa new group.
●             Attach the Launch Templateto the ASG.
●             Define the desirednumber of instances, minimum and maximumscaling
limits.
●             Select the VPC and subnets forinstance deployment.

4.  Configure ElasticLoad Balancer (ELB)(Optional but Recommended)
●             Go to EC2 Dashboard→ Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer.
●             Choose Application Load Balancer(ALB) and configurethe target group.
●             Attach the Auto Scaling Group to the Load Balancer.

5.  Set Up Health Checksfor Self-Healing

●             In the Auto Scaling Group, define EC2 health checks andELB health checks to detect unhealthy instances.

●             Enable the Replace UnhealthyInstances option to automatically replace failed instances.

6.  Configure Auto Scaling Policieswith CloudWatch Metrics

●             Navigate to Auto ScalingGroup → Scaling Policies.

●             Choose a scalingpolicy (e.g., Target Tracking, Step Scaling, or Scheduled
Scaling).
●             Set up CloudWatch alarms to trigger scalingactions based on metrics like

CPU utilization, network traffic, or request count.

7.  Test the Self-Healing Mechanism
●             Manually terminate an instance in the Auto Scaling Group and observehow AWS automatically launches a replacement.
●             Stress test the application to see how Auto Scalingresponds to demand changes.

8.  Monitor and Optimize Scaling
●             Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor performance and adjust scalingpolicies as needed.
●             Enable AWS Auto ScalingNotifications using Amazon SNS for alerts on

scaling events.

Conclusion
This setup ensures that application instancesare automatically replacedif they fail, and resources scale dynamically based on demand. By
